## Developed a Green Bank App using Python and Tkinter
### Description
Designed and implemented a user-friendly desktop application using Python and Tkinter to support a green bank's initiatives. The application allows users to:

* `Track their carbon footprint`: Users can input various activities like travel, energy consumption, and waste generation to calculate their estimated carbon footprint.
* `Explore sustainable solutions`: The app provides information and resources about eco-friendly practices and sustainable alternatives users can adopt in their daily lives.
* `Connect with green initiatives`: Users can discover and engage with local green initiatives, organizations, and businesses, fostering a sense of community and environmental responsibility.
